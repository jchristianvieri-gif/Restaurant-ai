https://restaurant-ai-xi-dun-azure.vercel.app/

Deployment Date: September 28, 2025



ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW



TECH STACK IMPLEMENTATION:

‚Ä¢ Frontend: Next.js 14 (Completed ‚úÖ)

‚Ä¢ Database: Supabase PostgreSQL (Completed ‚úÖ)

‚Ä¢ AI Framework: LangChain + Google Gemini Vision (Completed ‚úÖ)

‚Ä¢ Payment Gateway: Midtrans Sandbox (Completed ‚úÖ)

‚Ä¢ File Handling: Formidable (Completed ‚úÖ)



ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:

‚Ä¢ Custom API Routes over n8n: Chosen for faster MVP development and simpler Vercel deployment

‚Ä¢ LangChain Integration: Provides structured AI workflow with proper error handling

‚Ä¢ Fallback Mechanism: Smart filename-based product detection when AI service is unavailable



WORKFLOW DESCRIPTIONS



1.	AI PRODUCT EXTRACTION WORKFLOW:



Admin Uploads Image ‚Üí Formidable Processes File ‚Üí LangChain + Gemini AI Analysis ‚Üí 

JSON Data Extraction ‚Üí Save to Supabase ‚Üí Display on Landing Page



Steps:

- Admin uploads product image via /admin interface

- Image processed using Formidable (no multer compatibility issues)

- LangChain with Google Gemini Vision analyzes image content

- AI extracts: Product Name, Description, and Price in IDR

- Data validated and saved to Supabase database

- New product automatically appears on landing page



2.	PAYMENT PROCESSING WORKFLOW:



Customer Adds to Cart ‚Üí Proceeds to Checkout ‚Üí Midtrans Payment ‚Üí 

Webhook Callback ‚Üí Order Confirmation



Steps:

- Customer selects products and adds to cart

- Checkout form collects customer information

- Midtrans Snap API generates payment interface

- Payment processed through sandbox environment

- Webhook endpoint updates order status in database

- Success page confirms order completion



3. ERROR HANDLING & FALLBACK SYSTEM:

- Primary: AI extraction with LangChain + Google Gemini

- Fallback: Smart filename-based product detection (e.g., ‚Äúburger.jpg‚Äù ‚Üí Burger product)
